# Source code for YouTube Videos

Hello!

I have a [YouTube Channel where I teach JavaScript!](https://www.youtube.com/user/hswolff)

In those videos sometimes I show code.

This is where I share that code!

# Setup

I'm using Yarn, with workspaces, and PnP.

- `yarn install`
- `yarn workspace <workspace name> start`
